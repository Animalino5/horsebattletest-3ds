## WHAT IS HORSE BATTLE TEST

Horse Battle Test is a Horse Race Tests (by Snakesandrews on Twitter) fangame.
In this one, they bounce, but not for carrots...
ITS FOR CHESTS WOOOOOOOOOO!
i made the game some months ago on itch.io, and i really liked it.
but then i discovered that i could make games for the 3ds........
and i really wanted my little game in there.
thats it.

### KNOWN BUGS

 * It may blackscreen. Reason not known.
 * When your oponent is faster than you and you collide with him, you gain his speed.
 * This may not count as a bug necessarily, but it does NOT load in emulators. That is a consistent problem across all Lovepotion games.

### CREDITS!!!

* @.cinnamilk. on discord for playtesting!
* @slineryo on discord for helping me fix a bug!
